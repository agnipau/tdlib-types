# tdlib-types

This library provides all the definitions found on [TDLib TL
schema](https://github.com/tdlib/td/blob/master/td/generate/scheme/td_api.tl)
as rust types.

[tdlib-types/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/agnipau/tdlib-types/blob/master/tdlib-types/src/lib.rs)
is generated by running `cargo r` inside
[tl-codegen](https://github.com/agnipau/tl-codegen).

The reason about not using build.rs is because some things require manual
interventions: for example wrapping large enum variants inside `Box`.
Eventually the generator will become so smart that these things will be done
by him but for now this is not the case.

This crate is optionally used by
[tdjson](https://github.com/agnipau/tdjson-rs), only if you enable the
`types` feature.

```toml
tdjson =  { git = "https://github.com/agnipau/tdjson-rs", features = ["types"] }
```

To use tdjson with the `types` feature you should also use this crate.
For example if you want to send typed requests with tdjson you need this
crate.
